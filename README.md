# daliuge-logical-graphs
The correct way to run logical graph editor is like this:

dlg lgweb -d /Users/Chen/proj/daliuge-logical-graphs -t /tmp/pgtp

where the -d is the path having all logical graphs (u can git pull all of them from https://github.com/ICRAR/daliuge-logical-graphs)

-t is just a temporary directory
